# What_Is_Your_Agenda

Here, I've attempted to build a comprehensive to-do list application using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript operations.

This to-do has no modification or completion options, making it simpler to create and delete.

If you're unaware, a to-do list is a list of tasks that you either need to complete or desire to complete. 

We typically use this app to keep track of our daily duties.

Hope this helps :)
